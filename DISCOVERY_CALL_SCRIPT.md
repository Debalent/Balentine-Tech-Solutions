# Discovery Call Script: Studio Booking Operations Research

**Framework Purpose:** Listen, guide, and probe for observable pain—not feature opinions.

---

## Call Structure: "Observe, Don't Opinionate"

### 1. Quick Welcome & Context (1 min)

**Opening:**  
"Hey, thanks for taking the time. I'm a music producer myself—I run BTS Studio in Tulsa. I've been fighting my own booking and operations chaos, so I'm talking to other studios to understand what's working, what's broken, and what would actually help."

---

### 2. The 'Show Me, Don't Tell Me' Workflow Walkthrough (5-7 min)

**Key Questions:**
- "Walk me through your process for booking and coordinating a session, from first client contact to the end—just like you'd do on a real day."
- "Can you show me the tool or spreadsheet you actually use? (If remote: 'Would you mind sharing your screen or telling me what's in the file?')"

**Listen For:**
- Actual tools in use (Calendly, Google Sheets, texts, whiteboard)
- Manual steps and handoffs
- Where the process breaks down

---

### 3. Recent Problem Stories (5 min)

**Probe for Specifics:**
- "Tell me about a recent time when the process went off the rails—double bookings, missing equipment, last-minute swaps, whatever comes to mind."
- "How did you handle it? What did you have to scramble to fix?"
- "What did it cost you? (Time, stress, actual lost revenue, unhappy clients?)"

**Critical:** Push for "last Friday" stories—make it real, not theoretical.

---

### 4. Workarounds and Unmet Needs (5 min)

**Dig Into Manual Hacks:**
- "When your system breaks down, what do you fall back on?"
- "Are there manual steps or extra texts/calls you wish you didn't have to do?"
- "Is there a workaround or spreadsheet you're embarrassed to show me?"
- "What have you tried in the past to fix this? (Bought software, hired help, built something custom?)"
- "Why didn't those solutions work out?"

**Listen For:**
- Workaround signals = proof of pain
- Failed solution attempts = market validation

---

### 5. Existing Tools and Gaps (5 min)

**Tool Graveyard Questions:**
- "Are there any booking or operations tools you've tried—Calendly, Acuity, Notion, Airtable, anything else?"
- "Did any almost work, or were they total mismatches?"
- "What was the breaking point with those tools?"

**Listen For:**
- Why existing solutions failed (can't model complexity, abandoned features, too expensive)
- What they wished the tools could do

---

### 6. Emotional Impact (2 min)

**Get to the Feeling:**
- "How does this current system make you feel? (Frustrated, resigned, anxious, in control?)"
- "If you could wave a magic wand and fix ONE thing, what would it be?"

**Critical:** Listen for emotional phrases like:
- "It's a nightmare…"
- "We just cross our fingers…"
- "I end up here at midnight…"

**Write down direct quotes—these are gold for marketing and case studies.**

---

### 7. Solution Willingness & Value (2 min)

**Gauge Interest and Budget:**
- "If a system really worked—got rid of the spreadsheets and the last-minute chaos—what would that mean for you?"
- "Realistically, what do you think you'd pay if this was truly solved?"

**Listen For:**
- Dollar amounts (validates pricing hypothesis)
- Time/revenue impacts (quantifies value proposition)

---

### 8. Permission to Follow Up (1 min)

**Network Effects:**
- "If I build something that genuinely solves these pain points—could I bring it back to you for feedback?"
- "Also, do you know any other studios dealing with this headache?"

---

### 9. Thank You & Wrap Up

**Closing:**
"Honestly, this is so helpful—I appreciate you showing me the real picture. As a fellow producer, I know it's not always glamorous."

---

## Post-Call Action Items

**Immediately After Each Call:**
1. Complete Case Study Template with raw notes
2. Highlight best emotional quotes
3. Identify pattern signals (do others have same pain?)
4. Note referrals and follow-up permissions
5. Tag as warm/cold outreach for tracking

**After Every 3 Calls:**
1. Review patterns across studios
2. Update problem statement if new insights emerge
3. Refine discovery questions based on what worked/didn't
4. Validate pricing hypothesis against willingness-to-pay data

**Remember:** Your job is to deeply understand their operational reality—not to sell them on your vision. The sale comes later when you show them their own pain points solved.

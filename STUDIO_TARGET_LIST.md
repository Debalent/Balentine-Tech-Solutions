## Warm Outreach Script Template

**Subject:** Fellow Tulsa Producer - Quick Question About Studio Operations

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I'm Demond—music producer and engineer based in Tulsa. I run BTS Studio and I've been dealing with my own booking/coordination chaos (the classic "spreadsheet + Calendly + texts" nightmare).

I'm talking to a few other studio owners in the area to understand what's actually working and what's broken when it comes to coordinating sessions, rooms, and equipment.

Would you be open to a 20-minute chat? No sales pitch—I'm genuinely just trying to learn from other operators. Happy to share what I'm finding if it's useful.

[Calendar link] or just let me know what works.

Thanks,
Demond

## Cold Outreach Script Template

**Subject:** Quick Question From a Fellow Studio Operator

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

I run a recording studio in Tulsa and I've been fighting the usual booking coordination chaos—double bookings, equipment conflicts, the manual spreadsheet juggling act.

I'm researching how other studios in the region handle operations and scheduling. Would you be open to a quick 15-20 minute conversation? I'm just trying to understand what's working and what's broken for people actually running studios day-to-day.

No pitch—just producer-to-producer learning. Happy to share what I'm finding if helpful.

Let me know if you have 20 min this week or next.

Best,
Demond

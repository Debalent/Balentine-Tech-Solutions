# OKSBDC Advisor Meeting — Talking Points & Questions

## 1) 60‑second intro (scripted)

- “Thanks for meeting with me. I’m Demond Balentine, founder of Balentine Tech Solutions. My goal today is to align on priorities, validate my near‑term plan, and leave with clear next steps.”

## 2) Company goal (scripted)

- “The long‑term vision is a B2B SaaS company. Near term, I’m leveraging AI developers until I can afford to hire human developers.”
- “Longer term, I see this as a multi‑tiered tech company: core software development, a music creation arm, and later a film‑editing/production capability that supports creative clients.”

## 3) Founder context (scripted)

- “I’m in the Atlas School full‑stack program and will graduate this summer. I’ve built a portfolio of apps/platforms that demonstrate execution.”

## 4) Hiring & talent pipeline (scripted)

- “My hiring model is to recruit Atlas graduates to give back to my alma mater and build a strong talent pipeline. I also want to hire local Tulsa talent so the business stays rooted here.”

## 5) Operating model (scripted)

- “I plan to be remote‑first, with an office based at Gradient. That allows me to recruit Atlas alumni regardless of location while still building locally.”

## 6) What I want from the advisor (scripted)

- “I’d like your guidance on: (1) clarifying my value proposition and first market segment, (2) go‑to‑market and pricing for early traction, and (3) readiness for funding or grant pathways.”

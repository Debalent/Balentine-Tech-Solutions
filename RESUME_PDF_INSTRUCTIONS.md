# Resume PDF Generation

To create a PDF version of your resume:

1. Open `resume.html` in your web browser
2. Use the browser's Print function (Ctrl+P or Cmd+P)
3. Select "Save as PDF" as the destination
4. Save as `resume.pdf`

The resume HTML file is already styled for print and will look professional when exported to PDF.

Alternatively, you can use online tools like:
- https://www.web2pdfconvert.com/
- https://pdfcrowd.com/
- Chrome's built-in "Save as PDF" feature

The resume includes:
- Professional summary
- Technical skills (Frontend, Backend, Data & Infrastructure, Specialized)
- Featured projects (RelayPoint, CreatorSync, AI Development Toolkit)
- Education & training (Atlas School, US Navy)
- Professional development (OKSBDC, Gradient membership)
- Core competencies

Once generated, save the PDF file as `resume.pdf` in the root directory and it will be automatically downloadable from the website.
